        <h2>About Dexter Morgan</h2>
        <p>
          Dexter Morgan is the protagonist of the hit TV series "Dexter." By
          day, he works as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police
          Department. By night, he follows a strict code to channel his darker
          urges, becoming a vigilante who targets those who have escaped
          justice.

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Born with an abnormal mind, Dexter learned early on that he was
          different. After a traumatic childhood, he was taken in by a mentor
          who taught him a unique code of ethics—only to kill those who truly
          deserve it. His journey is as complex as it is riveting, and his
          double life keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>Dexter is shaped by a challenging childhood and the guidance of his adoptive father, 
          who taught him to manage his inner impulses in a structured way. This early experience,
           combined with the burden of keeping a very personal secret, has made him a deeply complex individual. 
           Rather than simply giving in to his darker nature, Dexter continually strives to maintain a balance 
           between his private struggles and the everyday expectations of society.</p>
